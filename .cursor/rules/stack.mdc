# My Project Stack

Tailwind v4:
  1. Do NOT suggest any syntax from Tailiwind v3. Please perform a web search if you are not sure, or ask the user to clarify. The upgrade guide can be found here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide
  2. v4 no longer uses a tailwind.config.ts file. Please don't suggest any code solutions implementing one.
  3. To modularize CSS styles, you can now import specific CSS files in the globals.css file. (@import "./colors.css";). Any custom solution that requires CSS should be created in a new file in ./app/styles/{new-file-name}.css
  4. Custom utilities now use a @utilities decorator, NOT @layer utilities.
  5. Since v4 includes CSS variables for all of your theme values, we recommend using those variables instead of the theme() function whenever possible:

Next.js 15.2 (App Router)

React 19

Shadcn / MagicUI / AceternityUI

pnpm for package management

micromamba for environment management (local environment at ./menv)
